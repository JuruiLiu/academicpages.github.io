Here is **Jurui Liu (刘举瑞).**  

I currently work as a research assistant in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/). I obtained my master's degree in solid mechanics from the [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn/). During my master’s period, I carried out a two-semester exchange visit to the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) in the Netherlands. Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate studies at the [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](http://nuaa.edu.cn/), earning a bachelor’s degree in engineering mechanics.

Research Interesting
======
I have a great interest in conducting experiments and simulations to investigate the mechanical characteristics of composite materials and to develope dependable predictive numerical models.  

Additionally,Natural materials, such as nacre, exemplify the remarkable combination of strength, toughness, and low density. I am also enthusiastic about employing mechanical approaches to unravel the underlying mechanisms responsible for the exceptional mechanical properties observed in biomaterials and bio-inspired materials.
